Corpus Erasmicum is a project to produce a digital text of the complete works of Desiderius Erasmus. The text is taken from the edition of Jean Le Clerc (Pieter Van Der Aa, Leiden, 1703-1708). The digital text was generated using optical character recognition software from scans uploaded to [Lovaniensia](http://heron-net.be/lovaniensia/items/show/1206) and the [Erasmus Online database.](https://www.erasmus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=eol.getdetail&field1=id&value1=2707)

This repository also contains ancillary materials produced as part of the project for the Master of Data Science Course (University of Durham, 2020-2021).
